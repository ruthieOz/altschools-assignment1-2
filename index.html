          My name is Ruth Idam, I am a passionate individual with a strong interest in technology, which began in 2022 through self-learning. I joined Alt School for its practical, hands-on approach and focus on real-world projects, believing it will equip me with the skills needed to succeed in technology. My goals in the School of Engineering programme include mastering software engineering principles, contributing to open-source projects, and building a professional network to prepare for a successful career in the field.
