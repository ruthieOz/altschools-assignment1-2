        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>Alt School ID</h3>
        <p>ALT/SOE/024/0095</p>
        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
          I am a passionate and driven individual with a deep interest in
          technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. I have always
          been fascinated by the endless possibilities that engineering and
          technology can offer. My journey in tech started in 2022 when i began self-learning, and since then, I've been
          committed to learning, growing, and contributing to the field.
        </p>
        <h3>Reason for Joining Alt School</h3>
        <p>
          I joined Alt School because I was looking for a programme that offers
          not just theoretical knowledge but also practical, hands-on
          experience. Alt School's unique approach to education, which focuses
          on real-world projects and industry-relevant skills, resonated with
          me. I believe that this programme will equip me with the tools and
          knowledge necessary to excel in the fast-paced world of technology.
          Additionally, the community of like-minded peers and mentors at Alt
          School provides an ideal environment for collaborative learning and
          professional growth.
        </p>
        <h3>Goals for School of Engineering Programme</h3>
        <p>
          My primary goal in the School of Engineering programme is to deepen my
          understanding of software engineering principles and to become
          proficient in developing scalable, efficient, and user-friendly
          applications. I aim to master various programming languages and tools,
          contribute to open-source projects, and ultimately work on innovative
          solutions that have a meaningful impact on society. Furthermore, I
          want to build a strong professional network within the tech community
          and prepare myself for a successful career in software engineering.
